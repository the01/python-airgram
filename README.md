# python-airgram

A python wrapper for making calls to the [Airgram API](http://www.airgramapp.com/api), which enables you to send push notifications to your mobile devices.

Since it is a very shallow wrapper, you can refer to the [official api reference](http://www.airgramapp.com/docs) for details on the functions.

## Examples
At the time of writing (2015-08-20) airgram is using wrong certificates ([see](https://api.airgramapp.com/1/)), which are intended for herokuapp.com. Because of this cert verification needs to be turned off.

### Using as a guest
```Python
from airgram import Airgram

ag = Airgram(verify_certs=False)

# Send a message to a user
ag.send_as_guest("your@email.com", "Test message from Airgram API", "http://example.com")
```

### Using with an authenticated airgram service
```Python
from airgram import Airgram

ag = Airgram(key="MY_SERVICE_KEY", secret="MY_SERVICE_SECRET", verify_certs=False)

# Subscribe an email to the service
ag.subscribe("your@email.com")

# Send a message to a subscriber
ag.send("your@email.com", "Hello, how are you?")

# Send a message to ALL subscribers
ag.broadcast("Airgram for python is awesome", url="https://github.com/the01/python-airgram")
```
